## Training Materials

### Interactive Labs

#### Lab 1: Basic Operations
```bash
# Objective: Verify system health and perform routine checks
cd /home/wassim/Desktop/ml\ scheduler

# Step 1: Check cluster health
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -n $HYDATIS_NAMESPACE

# Step 2: Validate business metrics
python scripts/validation/validate_business_metrics.py --quick-check

# Step 3: Review monitoring dashboards
curl -s http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/query?query=ml_scheduler_cpu_utilization
```

#### Lab 2: Emergency Response
```bash
# Objective: Respond to critical scheduler failure
# Scenario: ML scheduler pod crashed, pending pods accumulating

# Step 1: Immediate fallback activation
export EMERGENCY_ROLLBACK=true
./scripts/emergency_rollback.sh

# Step 2: Verify default scheduler operation
kubectl get pods --field-selector=status.phase=Pending
kubectl get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' | grep -i schedule

# Step 3: Restart ML scheduler
kubectl rollout restart deployment/ml-scheduler -n $HYDATIS_NAMESPACE
kubectl rollout status deployment/ml-scheduler -n $HYDATIS_NAMESPACE
```

#### Lab 3: Model Management
```python
# Objective: Deploy new model version with validation

from src.ml.models.model_manager import ModelManager
from src.deployment.progressive_rollout import ProgressiveRolloutManager

# Step 1: Load and validate new model
manager = ModelManager()
model_metrics = manager.validate_model('xgboost-predictor', 'v1.3')

# Step 2: Progressive deployment
rollout = ProgressiveRolloutManager()
rollout_id = await rollout.start_rollout('xgboost-predictor', 'v1.3')

# Step 3: Monitor and validate
await rollout.monitor_rollout(rollout_id)
```
